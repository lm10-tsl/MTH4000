It is possible however, for coders to develop their own data types. We won't have time to practice this ourselves (this will be done in <em>MTH5005 Programming in Python II</em>), but we can take a look at some data types that exist only in modules from the extended Python library.\n",

Each of these modules constructs a new type of data that could prove extremely useful to us.  NumPy defines <b>arrays</b>, which provide implementations of constructions common to linear algebra.  Pandas defines <b>DataFrames</b>, which include methods that aid in data analysis.  This week, we focus on NumPy.\n",
